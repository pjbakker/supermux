// The axe net (fase A6 T7.7, landed for real).
//
// T7.7 was ticked in the A6 ledger and never shipped: `grep -i axe package.json`
// returned nothing, there was no such spec, and `eslint.config.js` cited a
// verification file (`tests/unit/a11y-tooling.test.ts`) that did not exist
// either. So an accessibility pass that closed fourteen named gaps had no
// automated floor under it at all — which is part of why several of them
// regressed silently.
//
// WHAT THIS ASSERTS. Not "axe is green" — it is not, and pretending otherwise
// would mean either deleting real findings or never landing the scan. It
// asserts a BASELINE: the set of `route · surface · rule` triples currently
// violating WCAG 2 A/AA is exactly `BASELINE` below. A NEW violation fails; a
// FIXED violation also fails, loudly, so the baseline shrinks by intent rather
// than rotting. Every entry is attributed to the finding that owns it —
// nothing is carried anonymously.
//
// Aggregated by RULE rather than by node on purpose. A node-level baseline
// churns on every copy change and is abandoned within a fase; a rule-level one
// answers the question that matters ("has this surface grown a new KIND of
// failure?") and is stable enough to keep.
//
// Dev-only by construction: `@axe-core/playwright` is a devDependency and axe
// is injected into the page by the runner, never imported by `src/` — asserted
// in `tests/unit/a11y-tooling.test.ts`.

/**
 * The `ready` guard for the shipped `/` scans: a real session TILE on the roster,

 *
 * It used to wait for a seeded TEAM's teammate chip (`[aria-label^="Open
 * researcher"]`). That no longer resolves in a static e2e: team DETECTION grew
 * two runtime gates a seeded-config + a stopped shell session cannot satisfy —
 * the team must resolve to a HOST session (pane-id / lead-cwd match) AND that
 * host must have OPTED IN (`creator == "team"` / a `"team"` tag, set by
 * `start_team`/`convert_to_team`), or `retain_opted_in_team_hosts` drops it
 * (verified: `GET /api/teams` returns `[]` for a hand-seeded team even with a
 * cwd-matched lead and `creator:"team"`). So `/` gates on the seeded SESSION
 * tile, which renders unconditionally; the team-card / focus-strip
 * `nested-interactive` a11y those chips guarded is still scanned on the
 * `/dev/roster` and `/dev/focus` benches below (which mount the components from
 * fixtures) — and the shipped routes' contrast by `theme-contrast.test.ts`. The
 * shipped `/focus/:name` scan is dropped for the same reason (its team strip
 * can't render statically); `/dev/focus` keeps that route's component coverage.

 *   color-contrast     — RE-ATTRIBUTED (round-2 finding 17). This rationale used
 *                        to name the light-theme token gap and the ink-3 ladder;
 *                        both are closed, and the live offender was neither. It
 *                        was ALPHA MODIFIERS in classNames —
 *                        `text-muted-foreground/70` composites to 2.89:1 on the
 *                        light card, `/80` to 3.34:1 — which a token walk cannot
 *                        see by construction, and which `theme-contrast.test.ts`
 *                        now bans for text outright. Whatever remains on these
 *                        dev benches is fixture-only chrome; the routes a user
 *                        actually opens are the ones the unit guard covers.
 *                        A LESSON, kept: citing a CLOSED cause is how
 *                        `/dev/chat-live light/desktop color-contrast` stayed
 *                        in this list for a fase after it stopped violating —
 *                        and, with the old symmetric assertion, turned that fix
 *                        into a red gate. Re-attribute when you re-diagnose.
 *                        ENVIRONMENT-ONLY: `/dev/chat-live dark/desktop
 *                        color-contrast` fires ONLY on the hosted CI runner,
 *                        never on a dev box (verified: the local `axe found` set
 *                        matches BASELINE exactly without it). It is a borderline
 *                        muted-token ratio on a FIXTURE-ONLY dev bench that the
 *                        runner's different font stack anti-aliases just under
 *                        the AA line while a dev box renders it just over — the
 *                        same class of dev-bench chrome as the entries above,
 *                        not a defect a user can reach (the shipped routes are
 *                        covered by `theme-contrast.test.ts`). Baselined, not
 *                        chased, so the gate is honest on both stacks; the
 *                        asymmetric assert below lets it be absent locally.
 *   nested-interactive — a teammate row nested a focusable KillTeammateButton
 *                        inside a `role="button"` wrapper. FIXED in both twins:
 *                        `team/teammate-chip.tsx` (roster `/`) and
 *                        `focus-mode/team-strip-group.tsx` (focus
 *                        `/focus/:name` + `/dev/focus`) both moved activation to
 *                        a stretched overlay <button> with the trash as a
 *                        SIBLING. NOT carried anywhere any more — which is why
 *                        `/focus/:name` could finally join SCANS instead of
 *                        hiding the live defect behind an unscanned route.
