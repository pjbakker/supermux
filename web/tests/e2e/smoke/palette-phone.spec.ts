// The palette is reachable — and touch-sized — on a phone.
//
// THE DEFECT. ⌘K had exactly one visible trigger app-wide and it lived in the
// DESKTOP dock, so enumerating every visible control at 390×844 on /overview
// and /focus/<name> returned zero matching /palette|search|command|jump/: the
// app's discovery spine could only be opened by a physical keyboard. And when
// it WAS opened that way it rendered desktop metrics — 38px rows against the
// picker primitive's own documented 44pt phone rung, in a box pinned 20% down
// the screen with no safe-area inset.
//
// B3's ledger carried "the palette becomes reachable on a phone" (T4.4) as an
// unchanged non-negotiable and left it unchecked; this is that task.
//
// WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THIS SPEC NO LONGER LOOKS FOR A "Search" TAB.
// `31ac2c6b` ("remove the bottom-nav Search button — redundant with Overview's
// search") deliberately took the palette's phone trigger back out and moved the
// phone's discovery doorway onto the Overview's own roster search field. That is
// a product decision, not a regression this spec should reverse by pinning a
// control the product no longer ships. So the spec now asserts the two things
// that ARE still the contract:
//
//   1. a phone still has a VISIBLE search doorway on the overview (the roster
//      field that took the tab's job) — the discovery spine is not
//      keyboard-only again;
//   2. the palette itself, however it was opened, is a TOUCH surface: 44pt
//      rows, below the notch rather than 20% down the screen, inside both
//      edges, and pickable with a finger.
//
// Half 2 is the part that was actually broken and stayed fixed; half 1 is the
// claim in the header sentence, re-pointed at the affordance that now carries
// it. If a future change removes the overview field too, this fails again — as
// it should, because THEN the phone really would be back to keyboard-only.
