//! The five typed completion actions — the curated replacement for
//! `done_action: command:<text>`.
//!
//! **This is the unit that keeps the dragon dead.** `engine` never formats a
//! message and never decides what to send: it calls [`fire`] with a
//! [`CompletionAction`], a typed enum with no free-text arm anywhere in it. The
//! old `command:<text>` shape was a string the operator typed and the server
//! executed; there is no field here that shape could occupy.
//!
//! **The honesty rule (spec, DECISIONS LOCKED).** supermux has no MCP client.
//! It cannot send an email, a Slack message or anything else through a
//! connector — only the BOT can, because only the bot has the tools. A
//! `connector_send` completion is therefore an INSTRUCTION delivered to the
//! bot's pane, and every string a user ever reads about it says **"asked scout
//! to send via Gmail"** — never "sent". [`CompletionOutcome::Asked`] carries
//! that word in its name so a future caller cannot accidentally promise more
//! than happened.
