//! Agent→workflows hook endpoints (the agent-confirmed-finish tier, and agent
//! self-scheduling).
//!
//! `git mv`'d from `scheduler/hook.rs` and retyped onto workflows. **Every
//! guarantee carries over** — this is the narrowest endpoint in the codebase and
//! the owner signed off on each narrowing individually (gate G2); the comments
//! below are the originals, kept because they record *why*, not *what*.
//!
//! The reverse edge for a chain, mirroring `crate::board::hook`: every workflow
//! step carries a footer (`engine::confirm_footer`) teaching the agent to POST
//! here when its work is genuinely done. That makes completion AGENT-DECLARED —
//! the only party that truly knows the task is finished — rather than inferred
//! from idle. In a chain it is load-bearing in a way it never was for a
//! schedule: the done-edge decides whether step k+1 ever happens.
//!
//! **Auth (identical to the status + board hooks).** The request presents
//! `X-Supermux-Hook-Token`, constant-time compared against the session's stored
//! `session_runtime.hook_token`. A leaked dashboard bearer can't drive this (not
//! checked); session A's token can't authenticate as session B.
//!
//! **Scope rule.** Authentication proves *which session* you are; the object you
//! may act on is then constrained to one whose `session` equals the
//! authenticated session. So an agent can only confirm a run in its own pane —
//! never someone else's. Advancing is idempotent with the idle edge through the
//! shared fire-guard in `engine` (no step is ever delivered twice).
//!
//! ## `POST /api/hook/workflow/create` — an agent scheduling its own work
//!
//! A REAL CAPABILITY INCREASE — a running agent can put a recurring job on the
//! host with no human in the loop — so it is deliberately narrow:
//!
//! - **Scope is structural, not checked.** The row's `session` is the
//!   AUTHENTICATED one; any `session` in the payload is used for authentication
//!   and then discarded. A later refactor cannot drop a check that does not
//!   exist.
//! - **`kind`, `command`, `boot_*`, `bypass_permissions` and `_test_fire` are
//!   rejected outright**, so a workflow created here can only ever deliver a
//!   PROMPT to the pane the caller already occupies. Most of those fields no
//!   longer exist anywhere in the server; **the refusals stay** so an old
//!   payload gets a legible answer rather than a surprise.
//! - **The completion action may only be `none`, `notify` or `disable`**
//!   ([`complete::parse_for_hook`]). `command:…` is rejected (400) — on this path
//!   it would turn a per-session token into arbitrary host command execution —
//!   and so are `connector_send` and `message_bot`: a session token must not be
//!   able to arm something that emails the world or types into another bot.
//! - **There is a cap** ([`super::MAX_WORKFLOWS_PER_SESSION`]) answered with a
//!   429 the agent can act on, so a loop cannot arm unbounded work.
//! - **At most [`super::MAX_STEPS_VIA_HOOK`] steps.** v1 lets an agent chain its
//!   own follow-ups; the single-prompt form stays the default.
//! - **No natural-language parsing.** The agent brings a concrete
//!   `schedule_expr` from the grammar `/supermux-schedule` teaches it; the
//!   server validates with the same `parser::parse` the bearer path uses.
//!
//! ## The two legacy aliases are PERMANENT
//!
//! Confirm footers already delivered into running panes contain the literal
//! `"$SUPERMUX_URL/api/hook/schedule/done"` with a `schedule_id`, and the skill
//! an agent has already read teaches `/api/hook/schedule/create`. Both routes
//! therefore stay registered forever as thin aliases onto the canonical
//! handlers. This is why ported workflows KEEP their `SCHED-…` id (spec §7.2):
//! the legacy `schedule_id` resolves as a workflow id, so no mapping table is
//! needed.
//!
//! ## The body is read `Content-Type`-agnostically
//!
//! Both handlers take [`crate::extract::LenientJson`], not `axum::Json`. The
//! documentation an agent copies (`agents/supermux-schedule.md`, and
//! [`super::engine::confirm_footer`]) writes the body with `curl -d`, whose
//! default content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` — which `Json`
//! answers with a bare 415 and an empty JSON body, i.e. `curl -fsS` exit 22 and
//! nothing the agent can read. See the extractor's module doc for why accepting
//! it is not a CSRF hole (the auth header is not CORS-simple).
//!
//! What is NOT here, and is recorded as a known limitation rather than an
//! oversight: an agent still cannot DELEGATE with its hook token
//! (`/api/agents/delegate` is bearer-only), and it cannot patch, enable or
//! delete any workflow — not even its own. Creation and step-done are the whole
//! of it.
